## Type Systems in Small Pieces

Type checkers and interpreters for various toy typed languages.

Each file is a standalone implementation, including a parser for S-expression based syntax, a type checker if any, an interpreter and a bunch of examples written in this language.

Any comments or pull requests are welcomed.
